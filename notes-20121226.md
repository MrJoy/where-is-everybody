= some notes

the first implementation here differs from this somewhat but these notes from
4 months ago are included here to illustrate the ideas behind the project.

= modelling the milky way galaxy as 
  - a disk
  - 100k ly diameter
  - 1k ly thick
  - sprinkled pseudo randomly with 300 billion suns
  - h=height of each is normal distribution above/below the galactic plane such that 3 stddev = 1k, outliers roll again
  - r=radius of each is abs(normal centered on center)
  - l=longitude of each is just random 0..2pi
  - TODO: model arms
  - TODO: star formation, death

== broad definitions
  - technological civilization defined as radio telescopes
  - space faring civilization defined as one capable of exploiting solar system
    resources (eg: 0.1% of population off planet)

== simplifying assumptions
  - some portion of suns have habitable zone planets
  - all suns have physical resources, whether in planets or planetoids
  - starfaring life evolves rarely
  - space faring civilization does not require planets, just raw materials and
    energy (which may be fusion or solar or tbd)
  - a colony seed therefore has the technology to colonize any star system it
    lands on regardless of habitable zone.
  - a colony event always infects the closest world without space faring civilization

== probabilities we can estimate from experience
  - pH = p(habitable zone planets,any sun)=pH
  - pB = p(cellular biology|habitable zone planets, per 1m yrs after first 500m)
  - pM = p(cambrian explosion aka complex body plans|cellular biology, per 1m years)
  - pT = p(technological civilization|cambrian explosion,per 1m years)

== other probabilities
  - pS = p(space faring civilization|technological civilization, per 1k years)
  - R  = civilization avg successful colony seeds per 1k yrs, any space faring civ
  - pD = p(civilization dies,1k yrs,any civ, space faring or not)=pS

each star thus needs 5 bits of state

but 3 four byte words of location information
hmmm
  1k          10 bits
  100k/2=50k  16 bits
  300k        20 bits

  36 bits of location



    (nb: 0..2pi in sufficient resolution to be <1light year at diameter,
    c=2pi*r, == 314,159k)

at start
  all planets raw.
  1myr time steps until a planet hits civ
    that planet then gets 1kyr steps
    if civilization dies, back to 1myr steps
